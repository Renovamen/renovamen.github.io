# Hi! 🤔

This is my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss).

The [previous version](https://github.com/Renovamen/renovamen.github.io/tree/vitesse) is built with [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse).

Anyway, just have fun: [zxh.io](https://zxh.io)

pnpm i
```
