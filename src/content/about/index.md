## Bio

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) department at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) advised by Prof. [George Kesidis](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) and Prof. [Lu Lin](https://louise-lulin.github.io/). My current research focuses on trustworthiness and reliability in multimodal foundation models.

Previously, I received my master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). I also interned at Kuaishou.

By the way, take a look at [some things](/projects) I've built as a web developer, featuring [ohmycv.app](https://ohmycv.app) - a sleek, in-browser, privacy-first Markdown resume builder.
