title: What to install after getting a new Macbook
---

## toc

Apple launched back to school sale recently, so I upgraded from a Macbook Pro 13" 2015 to a Macbook Pro 14" 2021. Though the look is not as attractive as the old one (to me), MBP 14" is still perfect in almost every way (to me).

Anyway, I am trying to write a self-used software checklist when setting up my new laptop.
