title: New homepage
---

I donâ€™t want to spend too much time on setting up my personal homepage.

The front-end code is copied from an open source personal website project of a cousin girl. The original author is a very outstanding person, a front-end expert. The author has a strong engineering mindset and delicate aesthetics. Her works caught my eye among thousands of works, so I directly used her open source blog code to rewrite this personal blog for organizing some development notes.

My English is not good, so the subsequent content will be mainly in Chinese, and you will rarely see English content output.
