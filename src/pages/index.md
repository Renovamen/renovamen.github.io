## Bio

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) Department at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) advised by Prof. [Huijuan Xu](https://visionlanguagelab.github.io/). My current research interests primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the continuity, generalizability, efficiency, and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in large multimodal models.

Previously, I received my master's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). I also interned at Kuaishou and PKU.

I do machine learning by day and build things for web by night. Currently, I am working mostly on [ohmycv.app](https://ohmycv.app), a smooth, privacy-first online resume builder. If you would like to see a more "web developer" homepage of mine, please see [portfolio.zxh.io](https://portfolio.zxh.io/) or [dashboard.zxh.io](https://dashboard.zxh.io/).
